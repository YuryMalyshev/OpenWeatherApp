# OpenWeatherApp

The application uses [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) [API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get weather data and display it using GUI.

The application uses Swing for the main part of the GUI and [Processing3](https://processing.org/) to display temperature changes for hourly forecast.

The application works best with 1920x1080 resolution but it can auto-adjust itself to other resolutions as well. (WIP: adjustment to resolutions below 1366x768).

The screenshots of the app can be found [in screenshots folder](https://github.com/YuryMalyshev/OpenWeatherApp/tree/master/screenshots).

The latest runnable version is found in [releases](https://github.com/YuryMalyshev/OpenWeatherApp/releases/latest).

To run the app correctly, it is needed to get an [API key from Open Weather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).

The project is built in Eclipse IDE.
